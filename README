This is a set of learning aids for the Rubik's Cube

Solutions and images taken from Dan's Cube Station (http://www.cubestation.co.uk/)

I wrote these set of tools for myself and am not finished.  If I do happen to finish this project, then I plan on contacting
Dan Harris and donating it to do with as he wishes.

If you find this, and find it useful, please let me know and I'll contact Dan to donate and to ask permission to use his materials for others.
